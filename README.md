# Introduction

AfterTrace provides a graphical environment for rendering, transforming, and converting between SWC and HOC formats of skeletonization data and neuron model structure. This makes exploring and editing neuron models easy and intuitive and helps to identify and correct errors before models are imported into the [Neuron](https://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/) simulation environment.

Work on this project is ongoing and many features are not yet available. As progress is made, the [AfterTrace Wiki](https://github.com/nathantspencer/AfterTrace/wiki) will be updated to reflect current functionality.
